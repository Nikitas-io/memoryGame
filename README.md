# Memory Game Project

This is my version for the memory game project. It is a matching-cards game with smooth gameplay. The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. In order to win you have to match all sixteen cards.
